a short description
Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.
She took it into school one day, it taught the class and no-one noticed any difference.
The above line has been committed and now i am adding another one without pulling the first one to see what will happen.
